# info
Editing The Cycle Reborn server data without you having to manually do it trough MongoDB Compass.

# what should i expect
- be able to edit
    - stash
    - currency
    - faction (points) progress
    - fortuna pass progress
- save slots - (maybe) in one you can play the game normally and in the others you can have the funnest fun

# will look into
- what session data is
- what season wipe is
- overflow stash space
- skip tutorial (for new saves in save slot feature)

# possible features (not guaranteed)
- custom notifications?
- custom crates? - probably could do it with twitch drops / insurance returns
- editing (equipped) loadout? - you can do it in game
- editing quarters? - you dont really need it when you are just messing around
- editing contracts? - would be cool to finish the fortunas favoured one (if i cant edit it any other way)
